# Weight Safe

WeightSafe is a privacy-focused weight calculation system designed to determine the total weight of passengers and luggage without storing or disclosing personal information. The system aims to provide a fair and efficient approach to weight measurements while respecting individual privacy and dignity.

Traditional weight measurement practices at airports often focus solely on luggage weight, which can lead to unfair charges for passengers who are fit or have minimal personal belongings. WeightSafe proposes a holistic approach by considering both passenger weight and luggage weight to determine any potential excess charges accurately.

WeightSafe utilizes a zero-knowledge-based system, ensuring that individual weight measurements remain private and are not stored within the system. By adopting this approach, WeightSafe aims to strike a balance between fairness, privacy, and practicality in the air travel industry.
